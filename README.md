# RANDOMPI

According to Wikipedia and other trusted sources, 

>In a sense that can be made precise, the probability that two randomly chosen integers are coprime is 6/Ï€2 (see pi), which is about 61%.

This assumes that pi equals to sqrt(coprime pair count / count of pairs).

/me being very dumb and curious, decided to calculate Pi based on random numbers.

In conclusion:

* Precise calculation of Pi using this method is *not* possible;
* This method is horribly inefficient;
* It's possible to calculate Pi up to two decimal places using this method.
